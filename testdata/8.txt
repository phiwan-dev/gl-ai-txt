The category "Aircrafts" on the Galaxy Life Wiki contains a collection of aircraft units within the game, which are noted for their high cost and long production time compared to other troop types. These aircraft offer several advantages:

1. **Immunity from Certain Turrets**: Not all turrets can target or attack these aircraft, providing them with significant protection against ground-based defensive structures.
2. **Weaknesses**: Despite their immunity to certain attacks, they are vulnerable to missile launchers and bazookas deployed within enemy Defense Bunkers.

In terms of upgrades, the category mentions that there are no level 7 upgrades available for these aircraft, indicating a limit on their overall customization or improvement potential in the game.
