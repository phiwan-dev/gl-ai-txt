The Galaxy Life Wiki provides an overview of the universe within the game, known as "Galaxy Life." This universe is divided into various planetary systems, accessible through a galaxy view that spans coordinates from (0,0) to (250,250). By clicking on a star or planetary system, players can explore individual planets. Some of these planets may be under the control of other players, allowing for interactions such as spying, helping, or attacking.

The galaxy view also includes performance improvements, enhancing its functionality and user experience. When a player clicks on a specific star, additional details about the player's status become available, including whether they are online (indicated by a green LED) or offline (indicated by a red LED), as well as their level in the game.

The wiki categorizes information under various headings such as "Colonies," "Obstacles," and "Systems." Additionally, there is mention of a "Tree of Life" feature, though its specifics are not detailed. The category also includes a subpage titled "Galaxies," which lists four relevant pages: "Colonies," "Obstacles," "Systems," and "Tree of Life."
