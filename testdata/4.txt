The game Galaxy Life features several military buildings that play crucial roles in unit training, storage, and deployment. There are four primary Military Buildings within the game:

1. **Training Camp**: This building is essential for training infantry units such as Marines, Bazookas, Flamethrowers, Looters, Starlinators, and Kamikaze.

2. **Starport**: Responsible for producing aircraft like Wasps, Hoover UFOs, Falcons, and Zeppelin.

3. **Factory**: Used to manufacture armored vehicles including S-Trikes, Beetle Tanks, Raiders, Moles, and Colossus.

4. **Warp Gate**: Acts as a storage point for units trained in the other buildings. When an attack is initiated, units around the Warp Gate can teleport directly into battle at the cost of minerals.

The game also includes several updates and bug fixes:
- The color coding of enemy units has been adjusted to Sparragon (Green), Friends (Yellow), and Firebit (Purple).
- A bug related to building upgrades during unit production has been fixed.
- Newsfeeds now include tutorial videos for better guidance.
- Issues with wall-crossing by units have been resolved.

These military buildings are critical in managing the player's army, ensuring efficient training, storage, and deployment of both infantry and aircraft.
